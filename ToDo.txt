Exercises:
  Exercise 2:
    Need to get a bunch of examples
    Need discuss how to use mediainfo to harvest information
    Need to discuss how to playback a file using FFplay
    People should try playing files in quicktime and see what happens
    Then try playing files in FFmpeg and see what happens
    Check mediainfo for the following specs
