File/Exercise Management:
  Upload Source_Uncompressed.mov to internet archive
  find a bunch of samples file, including SAMMA mxf
  Change sox to ffmpeg for spectrogram management

Slides:
  Slide 33: How do FFV1 and MKV Work Together?
  Slide 34: FFV1 / MKV for video preservation
  Slide 38: Is the analog signal properly converted to digital?
  Slide 39: Is the digital signal properly recorded?
  Slide 40: Does the recorded format match the desired specs

Exercises:
  Exercise 2:
    Need to get a bunch of examples
    Need discuss how to use mediainfo to harvest information
    Need to discuss how to playback a file using FFplay
    People should try playing files in quicktime and see what happens
    Then try playing files in FFmpeg and see what happens
    Check mediainfo for the following specs
      frame size
      bit depth
      codec
      compression mode

  Exercise 6:
    Need to make the following files (probably best to make these all FFV1)
      File with dropped frames (can be b&t)
      File with clipping frames (can be b&t)
      File with repeated frames (ideally not b&t)
      10 bit file with only 8bits of luma information
      File with AV sync problems
      FFV1 file with bad CRC checksums
